            The Motif Museum invites visitors to explore the powerful themes 
            within All the Light We Cannot See, Anthony Doerr's novel set during 
            World War II. Through exhibits focused on the journeys of Marie-Laure 
            and Werner, the museum offers a rich, interactive experience centered 
            on themes of survival, resilience, and human connection in the midst 
            of conflict. The museum brings to life the interplay of light and darkness, 
            offering insights into how these elements shaped the characters' lives and 
            their relationships during the war.
