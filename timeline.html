                successfully transmitted the first radio signal,
                marking the beginning of wireless communication.

                radio technologies.

                The second milestone was the rise of Amplitude
                Modulation (AM) radio in the 1920s. This lead to the
                establishment of commercial broadcasting. This era
                made radio a popular medium for entertainment
                and information.

                The third milestone was the rise of Frequency
                Modulation (FM) radio. It offered offered better 
                sound quality and reduced static compared to AM. 
                FM became the standard for music broadcasting, 
                especially from the 1950s onward.
